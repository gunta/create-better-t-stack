## Welcome to the {{projectName}} API

The {{projectName}} API is organized around REST principles. It accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.{{projectName}}.com/v1
```

For local development:

```
http://localhost:3001/v1
```

## Authentication

The {{projectName}} API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Dashboard.

Authentication to the API is performed via Bearer Auth:

```bash
curl https://api.{{projectName}}.com/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so on.
</Warning>

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Development**: 100 requests per minute
- **Production**: 1000 requests per minute

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1620000000
```

## Errors

{{projectName}} uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

| Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 200 | OK - Everything worked as expected |
| 400 | Bad Request - The request was invalid |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Invalid authentication |
| 403 | Forbidden - Valid authentication but insufficient permissions |
| 404 | Not Found - The requested resource doesn't exist |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on our end |

Error responses include a JSON body with more information:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "resource_not_found",
    "message": "The requested user does not exist",
    "details": {
      "id": "user_123"
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination

All list endpoints support pagination using cursor-based pagination:

```bash
GET /v1/users?limit=10&after=cursor_xyz
```

Paginated responses include metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "has_more": true,
  "next_cursor": "cursor_abc"
}
```

## Versioning

The API is versioned to ensure backwards compatibility. The current version is `v1`.

When we make backwards-incompatible changes, we release new versions. The version is included in the URL path.
